# Isomorphism

Prove that if two graphs $A$ and $B$ do not have the same number of nodes, they
cannot be isomorphic. I have started with the formal definition of isomorphism
below. Add your answer to this markdown file. [This
page](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions)
might help with the notation for mathematical expressions.

$G_1=(V_1 , E_1)$ is isomorphic to $G_2 = (V_2, E_2)$ if there exists a
one-to-one and onto function (bijection) $f: V_1 \rightarrow V_2$ such that $(u,v)
\in E_1$ iff $(f(u),f(v)) \in E_2$.

Response: Incomplete
Per in-class definition: Isomorphic - Two graphs are isomorphic if they have the same structure (ignoring vertex names)

If two graphs $A$ and $B$ do not have the same number of nodes, it can be proven that they cannot be isomorphic as follows:
